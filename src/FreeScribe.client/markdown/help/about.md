# FreeScribe

## Introduction

This is a application maintained extension of Dr. Braedon Hendy's AI-Scribe python script. It is maintained by the ClinicianFOCUS team at the Conestoga College SMART Center. The goal of this project is to have a easy to install Medical Scribe application. This application can run locally on your machine (No potential share of personal health data) or can connect to a Large Language Model (LLM) and Whisper (Speech2Text) Server on your network or to a remote one like ChatGPT. To download head over to our latest [releases](https://github.com/ClinicianFOCUS/FreeScribe/releases).

Please note this application is still in alpha state. Feel free to contribute, connect, or inquire in our discord where majority of project communications occur. Join our [discord](https://discord.gg/zpQTGVEVbH) ([discord.gg/zpQTGVEVbH](https://discord.gg/zpQTGVEVbH)).

### Note from the original creator and active contributor Dr. Braedon Hendy:

> This is a script that I worked on to help empower physicians to alleviate the burden of documentation by utilizing a medical scribe to create SOAP notes. Expensive solutions could potentially share personal health information with their cloud-based operations. The application can then be used by physicians on their device to record patient-physician conversations after a signed consent is obtained and process the result into a SOAP note.
